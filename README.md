# Voicifind

Voicifind is a small, community-based Android application that provides a safe environment in which people can discuss mental health concerns.
By developing this app, we hope to amplify voices that are otherwise drowned out in mainstream social media. We aim to ground people in a 
physical sense of community by providing a proximity-based application that will encourage people to come together to improve their well-being.
